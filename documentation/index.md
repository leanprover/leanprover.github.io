You can experiment with Lean by running an 
[online](https://leanprover.github.io/live/) Javascript version in 
your browser. If you have installed Lean locally, you can use it 
interactively with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or 
[Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). See the 
[Using Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/reference/using_lean.html)
chapter of the reference manual for details.

## Reference

- *The Lean Reference Manual*<br />
  [online version](../reference),
  [pdf](../reference/lean_reference.pdf)

The current version of Lean is Lean 3, and is under active
development. The source code and libraries can be found on
[github](http://github.com/leanprover/lean).

## Tutorials

Each of the following tutorials is available in an online version that
runs alongside a Lean in your browser, and as a PDF document. The most
comprehensive is the following:

- *Theorem Proving in Lean*<br />
  A introduction to using Lean as an interactive theorem prover. <br />
  [online tutorial](../theorem_proving_in_lean),
  [pdf](../theorem_proving_in_lean/theorem_proving_in_lean.pdf)<br />

The next two are incomplete and not fully up to date, but may still be helpful:

- *An Introduction to Lean*<br />
  A quick tour of Lean and its features.<br />
  [online tutorial](../introduction_to_lean),
  [pdf](../introduction_to_lean/introduction_to_lean.pdf)<br />

- *Programming in Lean*<br />
  An introduction to writing and reasoning about programs in Lean, as well as
  writing tactics and automation.<br />
  [online tutorial](../programming_in_lean),
  [pdf](../programming_in_lean/programming_in_lean.pdf) <br />

## Lean 2

The previous version of Lean, Lean 2, is still being maintained but
not developed. Lean 2 has special support for homotopy type theory and
a substantial library. The source code and libraries can be found on
[github](http://github.com/leanprover/lean2).

- *Theorem Proving in Lean*<br />
  A version for Lean 2.<br />
  [online tutorial](../tutorial),
  [pdf](../tutorial/tutorial.pdf),
  [quick reference (pdf)](../tutorial/quickref.pdf)
