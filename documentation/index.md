- [Theorem Proving in Lean 4](https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean4/) is a tutorial with exercises.
You almost certainly want to read it at some point anyway, since it explains foundational things much better
than any hands-on tutorial could do.

- The [Lean 4 manual](https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/) (work in progress) will give you an overview of the language.

- [Functional Programming in Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/functional_programming_in_lean/) (work in progress). We are planning to release new chapters every month.

- [The Mathlib4 API Documentation](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/) contains API documentation for the Lean standard library, and for the very popular community written library Mathlib (work in progress).

Lean 4 first milestone release is available. You are welcome to experiment with it, but please
recognize that the system is still changing, and if you are looking
for stability, it may not be the system for you. Similarly, the project
cannot accommodate feature requests at this stage. If you are trying to decide
whether to invest time in learning to use Lean right now, this
[FAQ](https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/faq.html)

You can also experiment with Lean 3 by running an [online](https://leanprover.github.io/live/) Javascript version in
your browser (see also the [community version](https://leanprover-community.github.io/lean-web-editor/)).
The [learning resources page](https://leanprover-community.github.io/learn.html)
of the community website lists many tutorials and documentation sources for Lean 3.
*Please be aware that Lean 4 is not backward compatible with Lean 3*.
